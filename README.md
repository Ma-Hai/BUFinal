# Section 3: Instructions for Reproducing Results
In this section, you should give explicit step-by-step instructions for using the documentation in your Project/ folder to reproduce the Results of your study. These instructions should be written in straightforward plain English, but they must be detailed and precise enough to make it possible for an interested user to reproduce your Results without undue difficulty.
